<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
<p>
  This assignment felt very much like the easy beginner assingment one takes to ease oneself into the workflow of the term.
  With just using html tags, the actual file editing was nothing new to me and was accomplished relatively quickly. However, I did
  learn some useful tricks concerning how to use Git well. I installed Git Desktop to make it much easier to clone repositories
  as well as make new commits that will no doubt help me down the line with further assignments.

<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
<p>
  This Assignment was on the more difficult side as I had to go through some tutorials online in order to find some solutions to the problems. I solved the first part
  fairly easily by simply tampering with the style of the divs although i did encounter some problems with the selectors. For some reason when I did class selectors as
  opposed to ID selectors I occasionally encounterd problems so i mostly selected using ID for my Java script.

  When it came to creating the new twits I at first needed to do some personal demos for myself. However, Once I got the hang of it became an easier but still lengthy process
  as I had to make sure that every div had its child matched to it to mirror the layout of the previous twits. This was the longest part of the assignment but not
  the hardest.

  The hardest part of the assignment was implementing the search. To do this i had a for loop go through each article and check the text to see if it matched the search input
  both inputs and string had to be converted to  lowercase first. In addition, i added and event listener to ensure that the search would update after every time a key
  was pressed
